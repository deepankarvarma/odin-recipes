    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This carrot cake is my favorite recipe, and I have tried many carrot
      cakes! If you don't like pecans, feel free to leave them out.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>

      <li>1 Â¼ cups vegetable oil</li>

      <li>4 eggs</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p><b>Step 1</b> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.</p>

    <p><b>Step 2</b> Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in carrots. Fold in pecans. Pour into the prepared pan.</p>
    
    <p><b>Step 3</b> Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</p>
    
    <p><b>Step 4</b> To make the frosting: Beat butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir in chopped pecans. Frost the cooled cake. </p>
