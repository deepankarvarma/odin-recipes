    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This ham tastes very much like the famous honey baked ham but costs much
      less, and there's no need to fight the crowds at holiday time. You can
      even buy the ham presliced to make it easier and more like the original.
      It is very good. I make this while preparing the rest of the meal in the
      kitchen so that I don't forget to baste!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ham</li>

      <li>Cloves</li>

      <li>Honey</li>

      <li>Corn Syrup</li>

      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
      Use a sharp knife to score the ham (in other words, make criss-cross
      slashes). Stud the ham evenly with cloves. Heat the honey, corn syrup, and
      butter in a double boiler to make the glaze. Brush the glaze over the ham
      and bake in a foil-lined pan for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, brushing
      every 15 minutes or so with the glaze. Broil the ham for a few minutes
      before removing it from the oven.
